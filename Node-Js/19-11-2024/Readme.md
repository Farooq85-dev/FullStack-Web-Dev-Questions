### 21) Explain crypto module in Node.js

#### The crypto module provides cryptographic functionality, such as encryption, decryption, and hashing of data.

### 22) What is callback hell?

#### Callback hell refers to the problematic situation caused by deeply nested callbacks, making code difficult to read and maintain.

### 23) Explain the use of timers module in Node.js.

#### The timers module allows execution of code after a specified delay or immediately in the next event loop cycle using functions like `setTimeout()` and `setImmediate()`.

### 24) What is the difference between setImmediate() and process.nextTick() methods?

#### `process.nextTick()` executes callbacks at the start of the next event loop, while `setImmediate()` executes them at the end of the current event loop.

### 25) What is the difference between setTimeout() and setImmediate() method?

#### `setTimeout()` schedules a callback after a specified delay, whereas `setImmediate()` executes it immediately after I/O events.
