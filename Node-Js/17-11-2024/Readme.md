### 1) What is Node.js?

#### Node.js is a JavaScript engine used for executingJavaScript code outside the browser, commonly used to build scalable backend applications.

### 2) What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?

#### JavaScript is a scripting language, while Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side.

### 3) Is Node.js single-threaded?

#### Yes, Node.js is single-threaded but uses event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O to handle multiple requests efficiently.

### 4) What kind of API function is supported by Node.js?

#### Node.js supports both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) API functions.

### 5) What is a module in Node.js?

#### A module in Node.js is a block of code that provides specific functionality, which can be reused across different parts of an application.

### 6) What is npm and its advantages?

#### npm is the default package manager for Node.js,offering benefits like dependency management, version control,and a centralized repository.

### 7) What is middleware?

#### Middleware functions execute between the request and response cycle, performing tasks like logging, authentication, and data processing.

### 8) How does Node.js handle concurrency despite being single-threaded?

#### Node.js handles concurrency through asynchronous, non-blocking operations, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously within a single thread.

### 9) What is control flow in Node.js?

#### Control flow refers to the order in which code statements and functions are executed, managing asynchronous operations and error handling.

### 10) What do you mean by event loop in Node.js?

#### The event loop is a mechanism that processes asynchronous tasks in a single thread by continuously checking for and executing callback functions.
